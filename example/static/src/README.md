# Brunch for Django

This is a very simple [Brunch](http://brunch.io) skeleton for [Django](http://djangoproject.com) projects.

### Features
- JavaScript concatenation and minification
- CommonJS Modules
- Stylus / CSS compilation, concatenation and minification
- Source Maps
- Browser auto-reload

### Getting Started

First you will need to create a `static` folder on the root of your Django project, right next to `manage.py`.

```
$ mkdir static
```

Then create the brunch application folder. I use the name `src` for the brunch folder to make it obvious that's where the sources go.

```
$ brunch new gh:gcollazo/brunch-for-django src
```

Then install all of the skeleton dependencies with `npm`.

```
$ cd src
$ npm install
```

Once that's done you can test the project by running the `watch` command with the `-s` flag to enable a webserver.

```
$ brunch watch -s
```

Now navigate to `http://localhost:3333` and make sure you see a success message.

Notice that the brunch command created a `dist` folder right next to the `src` folder we created earlier. This is where all the compiled and minified files are going to go.

Now we must change our Django `settings.py` so that when we do `manage.py collectstatic` the command knows where to get the files from, the `diet` folder.

```python
# settings.py

BRUNCH_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static', 'src')
STATIC_URL = '/static/dist/'

STATICFILES_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static', 'dist'),
)
```

Now we want `brunch` to be running constantly on the background and building files as soon as we change them. For that we'll make a custom `manage.py` command.

Create an app on your project.

```
$ manage.py startapp core
$ cd core

$ mkdir management
$ cd management
$ touch __init__.py

$ mkdir commands
$ cd commands
$ touch __init__.py
```

Now create a new file in the `core/management/commands` directory called `brunchserver.py`.

```python
# This command is based on the one created
# by Brandon Konkle (@bkonkle) for Grunt
# Read more: http://bit.ly/1mdGLgv

import os
import subprocess
import atexit
import signal

from django.conf import settings
from django.contrib.staticfiles.management.commands.runserver import Command\
    as StaticfilesRunserverCommand


class Command(StaticfilesRunserverCommand):

    def inner_run(self, *args, **options):
        self.start_brunch()
        return super().inner_run(*args, **options)

    def start_brunch(self):
        self.stdout.write('--> Starting brunch')
        self.brunch_process = subprocess.Popen(
            ['cd {0} && brunch watch --server'.format(settings.BRUNCH_DIR)],
            shell=True,
            stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
            stdout=self.stdout,
            stderr=self.stderr,
        )

        self.stdout.write('--> Brunch process on pid {0}'.format(self.brunch_process.pid))

        def kill_brunch_process(pid):
            self.stdout.write('--> Closing brunch process')
            os.kill(pid, signal.SIGTERM)

        atexit.register(kill_brunch_process, self.brunch_process.pid)

```

Now you should be able to run

```
$ manage.py brunchserver
```

That will run the Django development server and the Brunch server.

There's one more thing. You need to insert the scripts and styles on your `base.html` file.

```html
<!-- base.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'stylesheets/app.css' %}">

<script src="{% static 'javascripts/app.js' %}"></script>

<script>require('initialize');</script>
```

Ok, now that's it. Enjoy.
